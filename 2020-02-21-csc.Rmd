# Research computing in developmental research

---

- How we *gather* data
    - Instruments (scanners, EEG, physio, eye tracking, smartphones/tablets)
    - Digital video/audio
    - Computer-based tasks, surveys
- Where/how we *store* data
- Where/how we *analyze* data
- Where/how/when/with whom we *share* data & materials

---

>"*How can our faculty and students be more productive?*"

>"*What resources (people, technologies, and expertise) will enable Penn Stateâ€™s developmental community to expand its impact and reach?*"

>"*What barriers (policies, technologies, and expertise) limit or slow progress?*"

>"*How do emerging trends around sharing, transparency, and openness affect our work?*

- What are we confident we know? (known-knowns)
- What are we confident we don't know? (known-unknowns)
- What might we have overlooked, neglected, or forgotten? (unknown-knowns)

## What's working well?

...for you with research computing...

---

- How we *gather* data
- Where/how we *store* data
- Where/how we *analyze* data
- Where/how/when/with whom we *share* data (and materials)

- technologies, expertise, policies

## What's not working well?

# Where do we want to go

---

- What aren't we doing but could be?
- What must we continue? What might be streamlined or phased-out?
- What are the highest priority/highest impact areas where we need to improve or build capacity?

# Preview of strategic plan elements

## Researcher Support

- We will ensure that researchers have **access to national-caliber advanced computational services for traditional high performance computing** and high throughput computing workloads.

- We will ensure that **researchers working with emerging technologies** (e.g. artificial intelligence, machine learning, immersive technologies, etc.) **have access to the tools and expertise** they need to accomplish their research. 

---

- We will ensure that researchers have access to resources and expertise to accomplish their goals whether they are working on local-scale computational clusters, university-scale computational clusters, national-scale computational clusters, or cloud-native computational environments.

- We will ensure that researchers have **access to modern software for administering** their research. 

---

- We will ensure that researchers have **access to appropriate resources for providing public access to their research**, whether through website tools or university-scale analytical tools.

- We will ensure that researchers **have the tools to collaborate** effectively across the university, the nation, and the world. 

## Research Data Support
    
- We will partner with the research-data-related offices across the university to **put in place a holistic approach to managing research data** from data acquisition through data archiving or disposal. 

- Through a combination of network technologies and data transfer applications, we will **ensure that large datasets can be efficiently moved** around the university, and to partners elsewhere, as needed. 

---

- We will partner with an appropriate subset of the research-data-related offices across the university to **ensure that the university can properly secure any research data** subject to access restrictions. 

- We will partner with an appropriate subset of the research-data-related offices across the university to ensure that the university can properly **comply with all public access to data requirements**. 

## What's missing?

## What should be the most important priorities and why?

## Software

This talk was produced on `r Sys.Date()` in [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) using R Markdown.
The code and materials used to generate the slides may be found at <https://github.com/psu-psychology/open-data-and-developmental-science-ODDS/>.
Information about the R Session that produced the code is as follows:
