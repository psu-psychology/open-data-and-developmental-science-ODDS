Given the recent focus on barriers to research productivity, what if we had a community conversation about that? Here’s an abstract:

Envisioning a more productive future for child development research

Penn State is already an international leader in developmental science, but how can our faculty and students be more productive? What resources (people, technologies, and expertise) would enable Penn State’s developmental community to expand its impact and reach? What barriers (policies, technologies, and expertise) limit or slow progress? What role can and should the developmental community play in the emerging open science movement? Join a constructive community conversation about these topics.

Rick Gilmore, Professor of Psychology, CSC Open Data & Developmental Science (ODDS) initiative leader, and Co-Chair of the University-wide Research Computing and CyberInfrastructure (RCCI) faculty governance committee will lead the discussion.
